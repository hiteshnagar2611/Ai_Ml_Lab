# List of Experiments 

1. Implement a graph in python using a directory and traverse it with BFS algorithm
2. Implement a graph in python using a directory and traverse it with DFS algorithm
3. Perform basic exploratory data analysis(eda) on iris dataset
4. Classify iris arieties using k nearest neighbour classifier from scikit learn library
5. Use support vector classifier from scikit learn library for diabetes predictions using Pima Indian diabetes dataset. Also perform normalisation of features before training
6. use the Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn to predict the gender of penguins using the Palmer Penguin dataset, along with label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical features
